          I&apos;ve been working on the web since before CSS3 was a thingâ€”mostly
          as a hobby or for local non-profits.

          In 2007, I graduated from{' '}
          <A href="https://www.northwestu.edu/">Northwest University</A> with a
          Bachelor of Arts in Music focusing on music technology. My passion for
          technology and creativity lead me to learn more about the web.

          Since then, I&apos;ve had a chance to work with some wonderful teams
          to create marketing sites, mostly in WordPress. I caught the
          JavaScript bug in 2015, and I can&apos;t get enough of it!
