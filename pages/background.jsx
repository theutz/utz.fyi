              I&apos;ve been working on the web since before CSS3 was a
              thingâ€”mostly as a hobby or for local non-profits.

              In 2007, I graduated from Northwest University with a Bachelor of
              Arts in Music focusing on music technology. My passion for
              technology and creativity lead me to learn more about the web.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, I&apos;ve had a chance to work with some wonderful
              teams to create marketing sites, mostly in WordPress. I caught the
              JavaScript bug in 2015, and I can&apos;t get enough of it!

              My wife and I moved to Helsinki in February 2018, and we love it
              here!
